<p translate>The Runout grade based on the consequence of a fall. The climber will not be hurt in the first three levels, therefore, the difference between E1, E2 and E3 is the length of the fall (or the distance between pro). For the higher levels (E4, E5, E6) the climber will get hurt and the levels represent the increasing severity of the consequences, from a broken ankle to death. The Ex for the french word exposition, which can mean danger.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>E1</strong>: <span translate>Over protected with bolts/pitons or good, solid protections minimum every meter ground up. No obligatory move.</span></li>
  <li><strong>E2</strong>: <span translate>Well protected with bolts/pitons or good, solid protections ground up.</span></li>
  <li><strong>E3</strong>: <span translate>Falls will be long but will not cause injury. Bolts or protection will be widely spaced.</span></li>
  <li><strong>E4</strong>: <span translate>The fall could cause slight injuries even if bolts or protections are not widely spaced.</span></li>
  <li><strong>E5</strong>: <span translate>The fall will cause serious injuries. An E5 might suggest widely-spaced bolts, just enough lousy protections or a small grounder.</span></li>
  <li><strong>E6</strong>: <span translate>The same as E5 but consider yourself lucky if you plummet off an E6 without dying, even when properly protected.</span></li>
</ul>
