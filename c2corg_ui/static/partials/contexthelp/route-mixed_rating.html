<p translate>The mixed grade represents the maximum difficulty of mixed climbing. It is not the rating of mixed routes (with successive rock and ice or snow sequences), but the rating of mixed climbing sequenceswhere the climber may encouter areas with rock, ice and snow mixed together with gear adapted to ice climbing (crampons and axe).<br />
The scale goes from M1 to M12:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>M1-M3</strong> : <span translate>Easy, slow sloping. The use of axe(s) is not mandatory.</span></li>
  <li><strong>M4</strong> : <span translate>The climber stands vertically and may use dry-tooling techniques.</span></li>
  <li><strong>M5</strong> : <span translate>Some vertical sequences.</span></li>
  <li><strong>M6</strong> : <span translate>Vertical to slightly overhanging.</span></li>
  <li><strong>M7</strong> : <span translate>Overhanging. Dry-tooling difficult. Less than 10m difficult climb.</span></li>
</ul>
