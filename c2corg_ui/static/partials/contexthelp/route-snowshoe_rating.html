<p translate>Snowshoeing difficulty grading:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong translate>R1</strong> : <span translate>Gentle slopes(< 20&deg;), with frequent and/or specific markers on established, well-traveled routes.</span></li>
  <li><strong translate>R2 </strong> : <span translate>Unmarked, less-traveled routes on gentle slopes (<20&deg;). No switchbacks required to move uphill.</span></li>
  <li><strong translate>R3</strong> : <span translate>Routes on steeper, more exposed slopes (<30&deg;), which may require switchbacks in the trail.</span></li>
  <li><strong translate>R4</strong> : <span translate>Similar as R3 but steeper (<40&deg;). On harder snowpacks it may be necessary to remove the snowshoes, or use snowshoe crampons.</span></li>
  <li><strong translate>R5</strong> : <span translate>Routes on very steep slopes (short sections >40&deg; or longer sections >35&deg;), requiring crampons, ice axes, or rope to progress upward over obstacles (couloirs, thin or exposed ridges, cliffs, etc.). Long homogeneous slopes >35&deg; without obstacles are considered R5 as well.</span></li>
</ul>
<strong translate>Caution !</strong> : <span translate>If most of the route is too difficult for snowshoes, or if snowshoeing is used for approach purposes, then the route should be graded as an <a href="/articles/188413 ">alpine route</a> (select the appropriate activity as well). If the route is borderline, both activities can be selected.</span>
