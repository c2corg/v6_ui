<p translate>The global grade offers an overall estimation of the difficulties of an itinerary and how sustained they are, as well as altitude and the normal duration of the itinerary.</p>
<strong translate>WARNING!</strong> The grade uses the same letter coding as the global alpine climbing grade but <u>they do not overlap</u>: A snow couloir can easily be graded D for skiing while its mountaineering grade would not exceed PD or AD.
