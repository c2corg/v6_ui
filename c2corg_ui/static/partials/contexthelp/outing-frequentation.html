<p translate>Crowding of the route during the outing.</p>
<p translate>The assessment is of course subjective, but a scale has been built to express crowding and the inconvenience caused by other people on the route:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong translate>nobody</strong> : <span translate>we were alone</span></li>
<li><strong translate>some people</strong> : <span translate>there were other people but not more than our own group (for climbing, there was one other party)</span></li>
<li><strong translate>quite crowded</strong> : <span translate>there were other people, more than our own group, but they caused no disturbance (for climbing, there were 2 or 3 other parties, well spaced-out on the route)</span></li>
<li><strong translate>lots of people</strong> : <span translate>there were many other people, in far greater number than our own group, which caused some disturbance (for climbing, there were 4 or more parties, with queuing at the belays or rappels, etc)</span></li>
</ul>
