<p translate>The configuration describes the main relief encountered along the route or of its difficulties only:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong translate>edge</strong> : <span translate>An edge is characterized by a main axis and two sides. Walk-in is generally covered by one of the sides or the edge start.</span></li>
  <li><strong translate>pillar</strong> : <span translate>A spur or pillar clearly untied from a face. Generally presents a rock climbing, but also ice and mixed climbing. The term pillar is reserved to rock.</span></li>
  <li><strong translate>face</strong> : <span translate>A face corresponds to a "plane" face where spurs, corridors or gullies are mixed.</span></li>
  <li><strong translate>corridor</strong> : <span translate>A corridor corresponds to a talweg. It is generally bounded with rocks in the form of pillars or spurs.</span></li>
  <li><strong translate>gully</strong> : <span translate>A gully is a straight corridor (starting at 70&deg;) and narrow (a few meters width). A gully often presents ice or mixed climbing.</span></li>
  <li><strong translate>glacier</strong> : <span translate>A mountain and glacier route mainly takes place on glaciers and the terrain morphology is not caracteristic. Those are classic glacier routes, glacier walkings or some mountain routes where there is no distinguishable configuration (e.g. Mont Blanc traversal). The 'Requires glacier gear' field also must be filled if the glacier has got crevasses.</span></li>
