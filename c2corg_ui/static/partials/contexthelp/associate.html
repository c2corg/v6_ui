<p translate>Associate documents (e.g. routes, waypoints, books...etc)</p>
<ul>
  <li translate>Enter a discriminatory part of the document's name. It is possible to search on multiple keywords. For a route, this includes the name of the summit(s) associated to the route.</li>
  <li translate>A list of documents is shown: click on the document to associate, even if there is only one result.</li>
  <li translate>For a route, the list of documents contains the routes associated to the selected summit or its sub-summits. Select the desired route.</li>
  <li translate>It is also possible to enter the document Id appearing in its URL. Eg.: for the route with url https://www.camptocamp.org/routes/57510/fr/triangle-du-pelago-eperon-nw-voie-demenge the Id is 57510.</li>
</ul>
<p translate>If you have mistakenly associated a document, you cannot de-associate it by yourself. You have to ask the guidebook moderators:</p>
<ul>
  <li translate> Insert a comment to this document and write "@Moderation_Topoguide" at the beginning of the message. This will alert moderators.</li>
  <li translate> Describe your problem, and post the comment.</li>
</ul>
