<p translate>The Labande descent grade is complementary to the global grade. It evaluates the most difficult passage for the ski downhill. It is mostly tied to the slope but also takes exposure into account.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>S1</strong> : <span translate>Easy descent which does not require any particular technical abilities such as forest tracks for example.</span></li>
  <li><strong>S2</strong> : <span translate>Wide slopes which are easy to manoeuvre, maybe fairly steep (25&deg;).</span></li>
  <li><strong>S3</strong> : <span translate>Slopes up to 35&deg; (equivalent to the steepest runs in ski resorts, on hard snow). Requires good skiing abilities in all snow conditions.</span></li>
  <li><strong>S4</strong> : <span translate>Slopes up to 45&deg;, if exposure is low (between 30 and 40Â° if it is high or the passage is narrow). Very good skiing abilities are required.</span></li>
  <li><strong>S5</strong> : <span translate>Slopes between 45 and 50&deg; or more if exposure remains low. From 40&deg; upwards if exposure is high. As well as a perfect downhill skiing technique, control of nerves becomes very important at this level of difficulty.</span></li>
  <li><strong>S6</strong> : <span translate>Above 50&deg; if exposure is high (which is often the case) or short stretches above 55&deg; with little exposure.</span></li>
  <li><strong>S7</strong> : <span translate>Stretches at 60&deg; or more, high rock bands to jump or more generally very steep or exposed terrain.</span></li>
</ul>
