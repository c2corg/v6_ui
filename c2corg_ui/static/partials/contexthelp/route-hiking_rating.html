<p translate>The Objective Danger scale evaluates the risk of natural snow avalanches, serac avalanches, natural rockfall, natural stalactite fall and fragility of the waterfall ice. The danger coming from human behavior is not in this Objective Danger scale except for the falling down of the waterfall ice triggered by the climber. Approach, technical section and return are evaluated in the risk scale.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>T1</strong> : <span translate>Footpath is well marked. Terrain is even and flat, or slightly sloped. There is no risk of falling. <em>Requirements:</em> None, you could also follow the itinerary in running shoes. Orientation is not a problem, usually even without a map.</span></li>
  <li><strong>T2</strong> : <span translate>Parts of the path can lack markings. Terrain sometimes steep. Falls are not to be excluded. <em>Requirements:</em> Good footing. Hiking boots are recommended. Basic orientation know-how.</span></li>
  <li><strong>T3</strong> : <span translate>Path is sometimes invisible. Hands might be needed for balance. Some stretches might be exposed to stone fall o cross moderately steep scree or rocky slopes where exposed stretches might be equipped with ropes or chains. <em>Requirements:</em> Very good footing. Good hiking boots. Average orientation capabilities. Basic experience in the mountains is advisable.</span></li>
  <li><strong>T4</strong> : <span translate>At times there is no path. Hands might be needed for overcoming certain difficulties. Terrain is somewhat exposed with delicate grassy slopes or slopes mixing rocks, easy nev&eacute;s or glacier which are not snow covered (no crevasse danger). <em>Requirements:</em> Familiarity with exposure. Rigid soled hiking boots. Ability to evaluate terrain and good orientation capabilities. Alpine experience is advisable. In case of bad weather, retreat could be complicated.</span></li>
  <li><strong>T5</strong> : <span translate>There is often no path and some easy climbing. Terrain is exposed and demanding with steep slopes and rocks. Glaciers and nev&eacute; increase the risk of slipping and falling, and may need the use of crampons, but not usually of rope. Alpinism gear and technical may be used for a small part of the route. <em>Requirements:</em> Mountaineering boots. Confident evaluation of terrain and very good orientation capabilities. A good experience of the high mountains and basic use of ice axe an rope are required.</span></li>

<p translate>T6 grade was deleted. For routes that are graded over T5, you may use activities "rock-climbing"/"alpine rock climbing" and the associated grades.</p>
