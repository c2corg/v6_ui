<p translate>This field allows to mention specific gear required on top of the usual equipment. It gathers information on the specific gear needed and thus, typical gear required for the activity must not be mentioned. 
Only "unusual" gear (in quantity or quality) must be mentioned. Examples of useless information:</p>
<ul>
  <li translate>ski/snowboard touring, snowshoeing: ARVA beacon, avalanche shovel, snow probe.</li>
  <li translate>alpine snow, ice & mixed climbing: crampons, axes.</li>
  <li translate>glacier route: glacier gear (checking the glacier gear checkbox is enough).</li>
  <li translate>partially bolted climbing: nuts and slings without further explanation.</li>
</ul>
<p translate>For further information, read the "Backpack content" articles, for which a link is provided below the text area. 
When displaying the route, those links are automatically added in the "Gear" field, and followed by the text mentioned here.</p>
