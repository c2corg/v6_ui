<p translate>The difference between rock climbing and alpine rock climbing is mainly based on the altitude of the summit, not on the type of equipment. In the Alps, the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li translate>Altitude lower than 2100m: rock climbing</li>
  <li translate>Altitude between 2100m and 2400m: rock climbing or alpine rock climbing, but generally the former</li>
  <li translate>Altitude between 2400m and 2700m: rock climbing or alpine rock climbing, but generally the latter</li>
  <li translate>Altitude greater than 2700m: alpine rock climbing</li>
  <li translate>For altitudes between 2100m and 2700m, both activities can be selected in case of doubt.</li>
</ul>
