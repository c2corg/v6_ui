<p translate>Technical grade for downhill skiing difficulties (toponeige). This is not a punctual rating: it depends on the length and configuration of the difficulties rather than the hardest section only.</p>
<p translate>It includes 5 levels. Each level is divided into 3 subdivisions: 4.1 = 4-, 4.2 = 4, 4.3 = 4+. The 5th level is open-ended: 5.4, 5.5, 5.6...</p>
