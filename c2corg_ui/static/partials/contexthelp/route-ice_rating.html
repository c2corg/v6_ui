<p translate>The scale goes from 1 to 7+:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>3</strong> : <span translate>Esay leaning climb (75&deg;) with many steep pitches. The ice is abundante and compact.</span></li>
  <li><strong>3+</strong> : <span translate>Same as grade 3 but offers a stiffer steep pitch (80&deg;).</span></li>
  <li><strong>4</strong> : <span translate>Climb with a stiff sequence (85&deg;) of maximum 10m high. The ice is abundant and compact.</span></li>
  <li><strong>4+</strong> : <span translate>Same as grade 4. The stiff sequence may be almost vertical et lengthier, up to 15m high.</span></li>
  <li><strong>5</strong> : <span translate>Climb with a vertical section of 20m or so. The ice is more spaced out and take specific shapes: cauliflowers and other ruggednesses. For waterfalls, these are generally cigars.</span></li>
  <li><strong>5+</strong> : <span translate>Climbing with a vertical section of 30m or so. Climbing becomes pretty technical.</span></li>
  <li><strong>6</strong> : <span translate>Climb with a vertical section of nearly 40 to 50m. Climb is technical. The ice may become really spaced out.</span></li>
  <li><strong>6+</strong> : <span translate>Totally vertical climb possibly with short overhangs, e.g. to join two curtains.</span></li>
  <li><strong>7-7+</strong> : <span translate>Extreme climb. Really stiff, it may be overhanging for several meters. The technique (among which gestural) used by the alpinist is similar to that of a rock climber.</span></li>
