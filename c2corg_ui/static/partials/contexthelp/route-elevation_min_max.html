<p translate>Minimum and maximum altitude reached on this route. If an hut is frequently associated to the route, minimum altitude depends on the route type:</p>
<ul>
  <li translate>For a route passing near another hut on the descent, the altitude of this hut should be used.</li>
  <li translate>For a traverse with no other hut on the route, the altitude of the first hut should be used.</li>
  <li translate>For a traverse with other stages (e.g. a <i>raid</i> from hut to hut), the minimum altitude will be the lowest point of the route reached between huts.</li>
</ul>
